# text_analysis_with_python
we will analize the stanford steve jobs speech, trying to figurite patterns as most common words, all this with python. 



In this project I will be using some web scraping tools for python to have a simple sight of the most common words used on two different speechs from transcriptions of stanford steve jobs speech.

After retrieving our data using BeautifulSoup, we will use the package word_cloud to convert our obteined text into a wordcloud image in order to focus on the words used on it.
Also, I will be representing the top 10 most commont words on each one using Matplotlib. The idea is to compare the difference between them within a year apart.

Finally, I will analyse the results in a very superficial way as the main goal for this project is to demostrate the utility from the used libraries for python.
